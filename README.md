# Sorting Visualization

This project is a web-based sorting visualization tool that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms. It provides an interactive interface to understand how different sorting algorithms work and compare their performance.


## Introduction

The "sorting-visualization" project aims to provide a visual representation of sorting algorithms to help users understand their inner workings. It is implemented as a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it accessible on different platforms and devices.

## Features

- Visualize various sorting algorithms in action
- Adjustable speed to control the animation
- Step-by-step mode for a detailed understanding of the sorting process
- Randomize input array with custom size and range
- Highlight key steps and comparisons during sorting
- Compare the performance of different sorting algorithms side by side

## Demo

A live demo of the "sorting-visualization" project can be found [here](https://sorting-visualization-gray.vercel.app/).

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/TutTrue/sorting-visualization.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd sorting-visualization`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser

## Usage

Once the project is running in your web browser, you can:

1. Choose a sorting algorithm from the available options.
2. Adjust the speed using the Delay inputBox.
3. Set the desired array size and range.
4. Click the "Shuffle" button to generate a new array.
5. Click the "Start" button to visualize the sorting algorithm in action.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are currently supported:

- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Odd even Sort
- Cocktail Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Shell Sort
- Quick Sort
- Frequancy Sort
- Heap Sort

Feel free to contribute and add more sorting algorithms!
